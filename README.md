# SwiftEx Delivery Management System
Welcome to the SwiftEx Delivery Management System, a C++ program designed to streamline the assignment and processing of delivery orders across **Karachi, Pakistan**. The system efficiently handles orders by prioritizing them based on urgency, order sequence, or delivery proximity.
## Features
- **Order Management:** Allows adding and processing up to 15 orders daily.
- **Priority Handling:** Processes urgent orders separately for immediate delivery.
- **Sequence-Based Delivery:** Orders are delivered in the sequence they were placed.
- **Proximity-Based Delivery:** Optimizes deliveries based on the shortest distance from the rider's current location.
- **Billing:** Automatically calculates delivery charges based on distance and priority.
## Usage
Upon running the program, you can choose from three delivery schemes:
1. **Priority-Based:** Handles and delivers urgent orders first.
2. **Sequence-Based:** Delivers orders in the order they were placed.
3. **Proximity-Based:** Optimizes deliveries by minimizing travel distance.
